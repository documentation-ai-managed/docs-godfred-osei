## Document Creation and Editing Tools

Create professional documentation using a full-featured editor supporting Markdown, MDX components, and syntax highlighting. You draft content with live previews, embed images, and use components like `<Callout>` for emphasis.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a New Document" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and click "New Doc".

    ```
    POST https://api.example.com/v1/docs
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit with MDX" icon="edit-3">
    Use the split-view editor. Add components:

````mdx
<Callout kind="info">
  This is highlighted content.
</Callout>
````

  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview and Save" icon="eye">
    Toggle preview mode and save changes automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search and Organization Methods

Organize docs with folders, tags, and powerful search. You query across all content using keywords, filters, or advanced operators.

| Method       | Description                          | Example Query          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Full-text    | Search titles and body               | `authentication flow` |
| Tags         | Filter by custom tags                | `tag:api`             |
| Folders      | Nested organization                  | `folder:projects/sdk` |
| Advanced     | Boolean operators                    | `auth AND (api OR sdk)` |

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Tips" default-open="false">
  Combine operators like `NOT deprecated` to exclude outdated docs. Use `filetype:mdx` for component-heavy files.
</Expandable>

## Export and Sharing Options

Share your docs via public links, embeds, or exports. Generate PDFs, HTML sites, or API endpoints for integration.

<CodeGroup tabs="PDF,HTML,API">
````bash
godfred export doc_123 --format=pdf --output=./docs.pdf
````

````bash
godfred export doc_123 --format=html --output=./site/
````

```javascript
// Embed via API
const embedUrl = `https://docs.example.com/embed/doc_123`;
```
</CodeGroup>
