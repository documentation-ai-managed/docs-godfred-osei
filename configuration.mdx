| Viewer  | No        | No          | No             | Yes           |

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add Admin" icon="shield">
    Go to **Users > Invite**, select **Admin**, and enter the email.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Set Viewer Permissions" icon="eye">
    For read-only access, assign **Viewer** during invitation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    "rules": [
      {
        "path": "/docs/private/*",
        "roles": ["admin", "editor"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

      "channel": "#docs-updates",

## Backup and Export Configurations

Protect your content with automated backups.

<Callout kind="alert">
  Enable backups weekly to avoid data loss. Exports include all pages and assets.
</Callout>

Configure via **Settings > Backups**:

```yaml
backups:
  schedule: "0 2 * * 0"  # Weekly on Sunday at 2AM
  storage: "s3://your-bucket/godfred-osei-backups"
  retention: 90  # Days
```

Export manually as ZIP or Markdown bundle for migration.

<Expandable title="Troubleshooting Backups">
  Common issues:

  - **Storage full**: Increase quota in cloud provider.
  - **Permission denied**: Verify IAM roles for S3 access.

  Run `godfred-osei backup --test` in CLI for diagnostics.
